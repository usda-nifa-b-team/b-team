Some initial scratch-quality scripts to analyse plant/pollinator data by National Forest and National Monument boundaries.

Check out this project from R studio and run script intersectShapes.R from the scripts folder.

You will need to authenticate to Google Drive the first time running the script in order to download the SHP files to the project folder.
