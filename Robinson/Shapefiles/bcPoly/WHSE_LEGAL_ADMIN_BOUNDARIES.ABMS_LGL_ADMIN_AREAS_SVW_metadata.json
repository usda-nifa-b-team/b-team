		"description" : "These point locations were determined from metes and bounds descriptions as written in Letters Patent for the following administrative boundaries:\r\n\r\n* Province of BC\t\r\n\r\n* Regional Districts\r\n\r\n* Municipalities\r\n\r\n* Electoral Areas\r\n\r\n* Islands Trust\r\n\r\n* Local Trust Areas\r\n\r\nPoint locations often represent the beginning or end of a segment defined by a metes and bounds descriptor. Point locations may also represent the intersection of two boundary line segments if it is not a surveyed point (e.g., the boundary switches from following height of land to the centerline of a river).\r\n\r\nA complimentary polygonal dataset that defines the administrative areas is also available [here](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc).\r\n\r\nIndividual datasets are also available from the following records:\r\n\r\nhttps://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/municipalities-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc\r\nhttps://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/electoral-areas-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc\r\nhttps://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/regional-districts-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc\r\nhttps://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/province-of-british-columbia-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc\r\nhttps://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/islands-trust-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc\r\nhttps://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/local-trust-areas-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc",
		"purpose" : "Administrative boundaries are used by agencies at all levels of government for land use planning, treaty negotiations, emergency management and planning, running elections, conducting demographic analysis and municipal planning. Boundary locations are points along the boundary that provide geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) as well as UTM coordinates.  They also identify the PoC (Point of Commencement), which can be used when reviewing metes and bounds descriptions.",
